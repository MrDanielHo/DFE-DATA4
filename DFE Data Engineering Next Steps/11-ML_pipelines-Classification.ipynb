    "## Misclassification\n",
    "If we want to classify customers into fradulant and non-fradulant, we could use a linear model, such as Linear Regression Models, to determine which set of features has the best impact for predictions.<br>\n",
    "This translates to finding the vector of betas that minimises the misclassification numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is meant by misclassification?\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of loss function, linear models typically minimise the sum of squares of errors.<br>\n",
    "But assuming the target value is one, as in binary classification, then such quadratic loss penalises large deviations from it.<br>\n",
    "Hence this argument is not ideal for classification.<br>\n",
    "Being close to one value does not mean anything in classification problems since we are interested in correctly classifying the examples in the correct class or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would use a zero, one loss which takes the sum of incorrect misclassifications.<br>\n",
    "For example, if we predicted correctly, the loss will be zero otherwise it will be one.<br>\n",
    "However such a function is difficult to minimise so we could use a smoother version of such a loss function which is using a logistic regression called the log loss function.<br>\n",
    "The Log loss function transforms any continuous input into a zero/one outcome thanks to the sigmoid function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ S(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ S(x)$ (Training loss) - The log loss function on the training data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} $ (Simple Identity) - The probability that the example belongs to a positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the outcome is binary (zero/one, true/false, etc.) we use the Sigmoid function to minimise the log loss function on the training dataset and typically this operation is performed in order to maximise the probability the the example to the positive class.<br>\n",
    "The probability of belonging to the negative class is obtained using the second axiom of probability."
