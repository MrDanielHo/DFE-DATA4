    "## CloudTrail Events\n",
    "Every API request captured is recorded as an 'event'\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple events are recorded within CloudTrail Logs\n",

    "# Amazon CloudWatch\n",
    "CloudWatch is the window of the health and operational performance of your applications and infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives you the opportunity to take advantage of the insights that CloudWatch presents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which in turn can trigger automated responses or provide you with the opportunity and time to make manual operational changes and decisions to optimise your infrastructure as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the health and performance of your environment is one of the fundamental operations you can do to help you minimise incidents, outages, and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CloudWatch components\n",
    "### CloudWatch Dashboard\n",
    "Using the AWS Management console, the AWS CLI, or the PutDashboard API, you can build and customise a apage using different visual widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resources within your customised dashboard can be from different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and configure different dashboard to represent the data that you need to see from a business and operational perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CloudWatch Metrics and Anomaly Detection\n",
    "Metrics are a key component and fundamental to the success of Amazon CloudWatch, they enable you to monitor a specific element of an application or resource over a period of time while tracking these data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different services will offer different metrics.<br>\n",
    "There are no DiskReads for S3 as it is not a compute service, so instead metrics relevant to the service are available, such as NumberOfObjects, which tracks the number of objects in a specified bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default everyone has access to a free set of metrics, and for EC2 these are collated over a 5 minute time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an additional charge, you can enamble detailed monitoring which will allow you to gain a deeper insight by collating data across the metrics every minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create your own custom metrics for your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom metrics are region locked.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anomaly detection\n",
    "This allows CloudWatch to implement machine learning algorithmms against your metric data to help detect any activity that sits outside of the normal baseline parameters that are generally expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CloudWatch Alarms\n",
    "Amazon CloudWatch Alarms tightly integrate with metrics and allow you to implement automatic actions based on specific thresholds that you can configure relating to each metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an alarm is triggered into a state of ALARM, it will turn red on the dashboard, giving a clear indication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### States of alarms\n",
    "* OK - The metric is within the defined configured threshold\n",
    "* Alarm - The metric has exceeded the thresholds set\n",
    "* Insufficient Data - The alarm has just started, the metric is unavailable, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CloudWatch EventBridge\n",
    "CloudWatch EventBridge is the evolution of Amazon Events.\n",
    "\n",
    "An event is anything that causes a change to your environment or application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big benefit of using CloudWatch EventBridge is that it offers the opportunity to implement a level of even driven architecture in a real-time decoupled environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules\n",
    "A rule acts as a filter for incoming streams of event traffic and then routes these events to the appropriate target defined within the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule itself can route traffic to multiple targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Targets\n",
    "Targets are where the events are sent by the rules, such as:\n",
    "* AWS Lambda\n",
    "* SQS\n",
    "* Kinesis\n",
    "* SNS\n",
    "\n",
    "All events received by the target are in a JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Event buses\n",
    "An Event Bus is the component that actually receives the Event from your applications and your rules are associated with a specific event bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "CloudWatch EventBridge uses a default event bus that is used to receive events from AWS services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CloudWatch Logs\n",
    "CloudWatch Logs gives you a centralised location to house all of the logs from different AWS services that provide logs as an output, such as CloudTrail, EC2, VPC Flow logs, etc. in addition to your own applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "CloudWatch Logs acts as a central repoistory for real-time monitoring of log data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unified CloudWatch Agent\n",
    "Unified CloudWatch agent can collect logs and additional metric data from EC2 instances as well as on-premise services running either a Linux or Windows operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric data is in addition to the default EC2 metrics that CloudWatch automatically configures for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CloudWatch Insights\n",
    "Insights provide the ability to get more information from the data that CloudWatch is collecting.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types on insights:\n",
    "* Log Insights,\n",
    "* Container Insights, and \n",
    "* Lambda Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Log Insights\n",
    "This is a feature that can analyse your logs that are captured by CloudWatch Logs at scale in seconds using interactive queries delivering visualisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Log insights to filter your log data to retrieve specific data allowing to gather insights that you are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Container Insights\n",
    "Container Insights allows you to collate and group different metric data from different container services and applications within AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Container Insights also allows you to capture and monitor diagnostic data giving you additional insights into how to resolve issues that arise within your container architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This monitoring and insight data can be analysed at the cluster, node, pod, and task level making it a valuable tool to help you understand your container applications and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lambda Insights\n",
    "This feature provides the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the applications using AWS Lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gather and aggregates system and diagnostic metris related to AWS Lambda to help monitor and troubleshoot the serverless applications."
