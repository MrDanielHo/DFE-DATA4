    "Snowcone\n",
    "* Need portability\n",
    "* Required a maximum of 8 TB storage\n",
    "* Need to perform online transfers via AWS DataSync\n",
    "* Inconsistent power supply and require backup battery\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowball\n",
    "* Do not require portability\n",
    "* Require a maximum of 80 TB storage\n",
    "* Need ability to run enhanced graphics\n",
    "* Transfer data via S3 API's\n",
    "* Require usable SSD storage\n",
    "* Need 10-100 Gbit transfer speeds\n",
    "* Ability to cluster Snowballs\n",
    "    * Clustering only available for local compute and storage workloads without transferring data back to AWS.\n",

    "## Edge Data Transfer\n",
    "With storage of up to 80 TB from a single snowball, it provides a means fo securely storing and transferring a large amount of data into AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running multiple Snowballs in parallel allows transfers of petabytes of data if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a rugged design and portable, the devices can be used in remote locations such as mining and oil sectors, or even in the travel industry, fitted to trucks, trains, and boats, providing a mechanism of easily collecting data and then transferring it back to AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Storage aggregation\n",
    "A common use cage is within the media and entertainment industry, the Snowcone and Snowball can be used as a way to aggregate data from multiple sources before shipping it back to AWS for transfer into S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, getting video and data from multiple feeds, like in the film industry, the data can then be aggregated to the Snowball device and shipped back to AWS for further processing and editing from the wider production team.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AWS Snowmobile\n",
    "* Transferring large amounts of data from a single location\n",
    "* Up to 100 PB per Snowmobile\n",
    "* Migration of entire data centres, storage libraries or repositories into a new location\n",
    "* can run multiple Snowmobiles in parallel, transfering Exabytes of data."
