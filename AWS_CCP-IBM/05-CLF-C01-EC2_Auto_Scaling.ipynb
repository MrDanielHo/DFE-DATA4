    "# What is Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?\n",
    "Auto scaling is a mechanism that automatically allows you to increase or decrease your EC2 resources to meet the demand based off of custom defined metrics and thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through customisable and defined metrics, you can increase (scale out) and decrease (scale in) the size of your EC2 fleet automatically with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "## EC2 Auto Scaling Advantages\n",
    "**Automation**<br>\n",
    "Infrastructure can elastically provision the required resources preventing the operations team from manually deploying/removing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Greater customer satisfaction**<br>\n",
    "If you are always able to provision enough capacity within your environment, then it is unlikely your end users will experience performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost reduction**<br>\n",
    "With the ability to automatically reduce the amount of resources you have when the demand drops, you will stop paying for those resources."
