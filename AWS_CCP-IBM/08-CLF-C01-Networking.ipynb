    "CIDR block address is a range of IP addresses and this CIDR block range can have a subnet mask between a range of IP addresses from `/16` to `/28`.\n",

    "1. Internet Gateway - this is a managed by AWS and is attached to the VPC and acts as the gateway between the VPC and the outside world.\n",

    "* Latency - Resources are in multiple regions and low latency is required.\n",
    "* Multivalue Answer - Gets a response from a DNS request from up to 8 records at once, picked at random.\n",
    "* Weighted - When multiple resource recoards perform the same function\n",
