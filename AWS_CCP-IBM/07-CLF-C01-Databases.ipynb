    "The 3 main services:\n",
    "* Compute\n",
    "* Storage\n",
    "* Database\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foundation of Application Development\n",
    "There are 2 primary types of databases:\n",
    "* Relational\n",
    "* Non-relational\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relational\n",
    "* Sometimes called SQL databases\n",
    "* They use the Structured Query Language to manage information storage and retrieval\n",
    "* Commercially available since the 1970s\n",
    "* Optimised around storage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-relational databases\n",
    "* Popularised in the 21st century as web development had a need to process unstructured and semi-structured data\n",
    "* Often distributed databases where data is stored on multiple computers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Databases defined\n",
    "A database is any type of mechanism used for storing, managing, and retrieving information.<br>\n",
    "It is a repository or collection of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are nine primary categories of databases available on AWS\n",
    "1. Relational\n",
    "2. Key-value \n",
    "3. Document\n",
    "4. In-memory stores\n",
    "5. Graph\n",
    "6. Columnar\n",
    "7. Time series\n",
    "8. Quantum ledger\n",
    "9. Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Matching the application and the type of database is essential for performance and costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The promise of the cloud\n",
    "The cloud promises agility - being able to respond to changes in a business environment as they happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes the ability to grow when needed - scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another promise is elasticity - the ability to scale up with increase in demand AND to scale down with decrease in demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Picking the correct database\n",
    "Things to consider include:\n",
    "* Size\n",
    "* Shape\n",
    "* Computational requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The above determines what type of database is needed for the application to allow for scalability and elasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "An application may use multiple databases - each serving a unique purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workload types\n",
    "### Operational\n",
    "Operational applications are the ones often referred to as Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "OLTP is centered around a set of common business processes that is regular, repeatable, and durable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include: e-commerce, content mangement system, or information management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data goes in, reports come out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database in the back end is generally relational, as the data is structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical\n",
    "Online Analytics Processiong (OLAP) applications are used for things like business intelligence workloads and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to gain insight, the types are:\n",
    "* Retrospective analytics - examining the history of the organisation\n",
    "* Streaming - gathering data in real time to discover trends or raise alarms\n",
    "* Predictive - using past data to predict the future - starting to use Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence\n"

    "# Relational Databases\n",
    "Relational databases provide an efficient, intuitive, and flexible way to store and report on highly structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These structures are called scheme and they are defined before any data can be entered into the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reporting requirement drive database design\n",
    "Schemas are designed and built around reporting requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases' expected output drives the creation of the database and how data is stored inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the schema has been defined, database admins and programmers work backward from these requirements to define how data will be stored inside the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "No data can be stored in a database until this work has been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing schemas to exisiting databases are expensive in terms of time and compute power.<br>\n",
    "It also runs the risk of corrupting data and breaking exisiting reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling data\n",
    "In relational databases, data is stored in tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each table or relation, contains one or more rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row or record, contains a collection of logically related data that is identified by a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data stored in a row are called attributes or fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually a table looks like a spreedsheet - rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "One column of each table contains a primary key that uniquely identifies the information stored in each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationships between tables are created using primary keys.<br>\n",
    "The primary key for one table is a foreign key for another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Integrity\n",
    "Data intergrity is of concert in relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of constraints that ensure the data contained in tables is reliable and accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "These reliability features are referred to ACID transactions:\n",
    "* Atomicity - refers to the elements that make up a single database transaction. A transaction can have multiple parts in multiple tables. It is treated as a single unit - either it succeeds or fails completely.\n",
    "* Consistency - refers to the database's state. Transactions must take the database from one valid state to another valid state.\n",
    "* Isolation - prevetns one transaction from interfering with another.\n",
    "* Durability - ensures that data changes become permanent once the transaction is committed to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keys and data integrity\n",
    "As part of the requirements to maintain database stability, Primary keys and Foreign keys are constraint (have rules that govern them), to ensure the integrity of database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity Integrity ensures that the primary key is unique to the table and is not NULL or blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential Integrity requires every Foreign key column exists as the Primary key of its originating table.<br>\n",
    "If four tables are related and a record is deleted in one of them, then the corresponding records in related tables must be deleted as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structured Query Language\n",
    "The standard user and Application Programming Interface (API) of relational databases is Structured Query Language (SQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be used interactively or programmatically to create, update, and maintain the data inside a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data access controls\n",
    "Relational database engines have built-in features for securing and protecting data but planning and effort are required to properly implement them:\n",
    "* Authentication\n",
    "* Authorisation\n",
    "* Audit logging\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data normalisation\n",
    "As part of the structure, data stored in relational databases is highly normalised.<br>\n",
    "Normalisation is a process where information is organised efficiently and consistently before storing it.\n",
    "* Duplicated is discarded\n",
    "* Closely related fields are grouped together\n",
    "\n",
    "Data should be stored one time a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields that a logically related (e.g. first name and last name) should be stored in the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing redundancy and keeping similar data close reduces storage costs and improves the efficiency of data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scaling and sharding\n",
    "Relational databases are not partition tolerant.<br>\n",
    "A data partition in this case, refers to the storage disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding another disk would be like creating a second copy of the database.<br>\n",
    "This copy or partition, is called a shard.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a shard is created, it uses the original database's schema<br>\n",
    "This is a horizontal partition of a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For it to function, logic outside of the database must be created to direct queries to the correct database.<br>\n",
    "This is because Relational databases are designed to only validate how data is stored.<br>\n",
    "They do not see if information belongs inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this complexity, databases are scaled vertically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal scaling adds a copy of the database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertical scaling is growing the server; usually by adding memory, CPU, or expanding a disk volume.<br>\n",
    "There are limitaions - only so many resource will fit inside a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these limits have been reached, a database will either need to be redesigned or broken into shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AWS Relational Database Engines\n",
    "AWS has 6 full-mananged database engines inside the Relational Database Service (RDS).\n",
    "* Amazon Aurora - AWS' cloud-native version of MySQL and Postgres\n",
    "* MySQL\n",

    "# NoSQL Databases\n",
    "Relational databases are highly structured repositories of data.<br>\n",
    "They use schemas to define how information is organised and the schema must exist before that database can be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fixed nature of data structures makes relational databases sub-optimal for analytical processes where data is semi-structured or unstructured.\n",
    "\n",
    "While relational databases are highly-structured repositories of information, non-relational databases do not use a fixed table structure.<br>\n",
    "They are schema-less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it does not use a predefined schema that is enforced by a database engine, a non-relational database can use structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data without difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NoSQL\n",
    "NoSQL is a general term referring to a particular type of database model.<Br>\n",
    "It encompasses a wide variety of different models that do not fit into the relational model.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL describes a family of schema-less non-relational, distributed data stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are popular with developers because they do not require an upfront schema design they are able to build code without having a database to be designed and built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this flexibility, a dynamic approach to organising data, that has been popular with companies needing to store unstructured or rapidly changing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is in a name?\n",
    "Initially, it described databases that used mechanisms other than SQL to manage data.<br>\n",
    "The NoSQL can be defined in 2 ways:\n",
    "* There was \"No SQL\" used when accessing and manipulating data\n",
    "* The definition has been expanded to mean \"Not Only SQL\". Some systems use SQL along with other technologies and query languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of NoSQL Databases\n",
    "* Non-relational\n",
    "    * Relational database model might not be a good for an application's requirements\n",
    "    * Data might be unstructured or semi-structured - the amount of data might be impractical for a relational database\n",
    "    * Data might be of one type and does not require the controls that come with relational databases\n",
    "* Open-source\n",
    "    * Not a requirement - there are many relational and non-relational databases that are not open source\n",
    "    * Developers of NoSQL lean towards providing open-source solutions\n",
    "* Schema-less\n",
    "    * Schemas can be created dynamically as data is accessed or even embedded into the data itself\n",
    "    * NoSQL databases have a reputation for being more flexible with the data they can accept and support agile and DevOps philosophies\n",
    "* Horizontally scalable\n",
    "    * NoSQL databases are often run in clusters of computing nodes\n",
    "    * Data is partitioned across multiple computers so that each computer can perform a specific task independently of the others\n",
    "    * Each node performs its task without having o share CPU, memory, or storage with nodes\n",
    "    * This is known as shard-nothing architecture\n",
    "* Does not adhere to ACID constraints\n",
    "    * Most NoSQL databases relax ACID constraints\n",
    "    * Most NoSQL solutions were developed around the purpose of providing high availability and scalability in a distributed environment\n",
    "    * To do this, either consistency or durability must be sacrificed. By relaxing consistency, distributed systems can be highly avilable and durable\n",
    "    * Using a NoSQL approach, inconsistent data is expected. This must be recognised and managed appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "Most NoSQL databases access data using their own Application Programming Interface (API).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some NoSQL databases use a subset of SQL for data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there is no standard query language that is suported by all NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some may have their own query language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Others support languages including:\n",
    "* JavaScript,\n",
    "* Java\n",
    "* Python\n",
    "* Xquery\n",
    "* SPARQL\n",
    "\n",
    "## A family of databases\n",
    "* Key-value - simplest NoSQL \n",
    "    * Using RESTful API a client can:\n",
    "        * `get` the value for a key\n",
    "        * `put` a value for a key\n",
    "        * `delete` a key from the data\n",
    "* Document\n",
    "    * Uses a document to store information\n",
    "    * Data is semi-structured and can be queried\n",
    "    * Schema is built into the document itself\n",
    "    * It is different from key-value as values can be nested and can be indexed and retrieved        \n",
    "* Graph\n",
    "    * Uses a graphical model to represent and store information\n",
    "    * Uses Vertices and Edges\n",
    "* Column family stores\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "Scaling is easier and cheaper as they can be scaled horizontally - adding compute node or disk node.<br>\n",
    "Where relational databases are scaled vertically - adding CPU, memory, storage, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL trades consistency for performance and scalability.<br>\n",
    "Relational databases adhere to ACID."

    "# Types of Managed NoSQL on AWS\n",
    "## Key-value stores\n",
    "Relational Databases:\n",
    "* Data stored in tables - rows and columns\n",
    "* Tables and types of data are defined before development\n",
    "* Storage and access patterns are optimised\n",
    "* Inflexible\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value Databases/Stores:\n",
    "* Considered simplest type of NoSQL database\n",
    "* Typically more flexible than Relational and offers fast performance for read/writes\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS managed NoSQL database that is a Key-value store is DynamoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value stores are designed for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays and are well suited for working with large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An associative array, also known as a dictionary or hash table, stores data with a unique identifier called a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data stored, one or more items, is the value.<br>\n",
    "This can include:\n",
    "* Text\n",
    "* Numbers\n",
    "* Lists\n",
    "* Documents\n",
    "* Another key-value pair\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is stored and retrieved using operations such as:\n",
    "* `get`\n",
    "* `put`\n",
    "* `delete`\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries to key-value stores are simple.<br>\n",
    "Lookups are based on the key and retrieval is often measured in milliseconds regardless of the size of the data returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value stores are not optimised for search.<br>\n",
    "It is very expensive to scan in terms of time and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are not suitable for applications requiring frequent updates or complex queries involving specific data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use case\n",
    "* Web applications storing user profiles\n",
    "* Shopping cart data\n",
    "* Preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time recommendation engines and advertising systems are often powered by key-value stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value stores are commonly used for in-memory data caching.<br>\n",
    "They can speed up applications by minimising reads and writes to slower disk-based systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary objects (pictures and other multimedia), can be stored in key-value databases.<br>\n",
    "However a better solution (in regards to time and cost), is to save binary files in object storage and use a key-value database for lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document stores\n",
    "DynamoDB is a key-value database.<br>\n",
    "Since it can store key-value pairs as a value, it is also a type of NoSQL Document database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document databases were invented to store semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of having the structured defined as part of the database in advance like a relational database each document in the database has its own unique schema that defines its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS managed NoSQL document database service is Amazon DocumentDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a document database, Amazon DocumentDB is designed to store, query, and index JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document databases are similar to key-value databases - they both use key-values.<br>\n",
    "The difference is that the values in a document database, contain structured or semi-structured data referred to as a Document.\n",
    "\n",
    "In semi-structured data, there is no separation between the schema and the data.<br>\n",
    "Each document stored has its own unique schema that defines what it contains.<br>\n",
    "The database engine uses this structure of the stored data to create metadata that is used for database optimisation and queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document stores scale horizontally - data can be stored over multiple (1000+) nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit that Document Store databases have over Key-value databases is that, in document stores, the data inside the document can be queried.<br>\n",
    "This is different from a Key-value store where a query returns the value in its entirety.<br>\n",
    "In a Document Store, queries can be run against the structure of a document as well as the elements inside it to return only the information required.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases include:\n",
    "* Web applications\n",
    "* User-generated content\n",
    "* Shopping catalogs\n",
    "* Gaming\n",
    "* IoT devices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Column family stores\n",
    "A Column Store, stores data using a column-oriented model.\n",
    "\n",
    "On AWS, the NoSQL column store available is the managed service, Amazon Keyspaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using columns allows databases to precisely access data needed to answer a query without having to scan each row in a table and discard unwanted items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column stores can referred to as:\n",
    "* Column databases\n",
    "* Column-family databases\n",
    "* Column-oriented databases\n",
    "* Wide-column stores\n",
    "* Columnar databases\n",
    "* Columnar stores\n",
    "\n",
    "### The structure of a column store database\n",
    "Column store databases uses a concept called keyspace to define the data it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "A keyspace is similar to a relational database's schema.<br>\n",
    "The keyspace contains a collection of column families that look like tables from a relational database.<br>\n",
    "The column families contain rows and these rows contain columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Column Family consists of multiple rows.<br>\n",
    "Each row can contain a number of different columns.<br>\n",
    "Each column is limited to its row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns are kept in their own row.<br>\n",
    "They do not span all rows like a relational database does.<br>\n",
    "Each column contains a name-value pair along with a timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "A row is constructed with a row key and one or more columns.<br>\n",
    "The row key is a unique identifier for that row.<br>\n",
    "Each column contains a name-value pair and a timestamp.<br>\n",
    "The timestamp is the date and time the data was inserted.<br>\n",
    "This is often used to detemine the most recent version of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "Columns stores are:\n",
    "* Efficient doing data compression and partitioning\n",
    "* Due to their structure, columnar databases excel at doing aggregation-type queries\n",
    "* They can SUM, COUNT, and AVG values\n",
    "\n",
    "Columnar databases scale well.<br>\n",
    "Suited for workloads that do Massively Parallel Processing where data is spread across a large cluster of compute nodes that could number 1000s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Columnar stores can be loaded fast and efficiently.<br>\n",
    "A one-billion row table can be loaded into a columnar store in seconds with queries and analysis starting almost immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an end-user perspective, the metadata in a columnar database looks and feels like a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some columnar database engines are SQL compliant and support the same controls that maintain the data's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases:\n",
    "* Analytical applications\n",
    "* Data warehousing\n",
    "* Big data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "## In-memory stores\n",
    "In-memory data stores are used by applications that require real-time access to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since data is stored in memory, it provides microsecond latency to applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "These stores are used as caches and the managed NoSQL service available from AWS is Amazon ElastiCache.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon ElastiCache has 2 no NoSQL In-memory database engines:\n",
    "* Redis\n",
    "* Memcached\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:<br>\n",
    "* A caching system is not a database. It is something that sits in front of a database to improve throughput\n",
    "* It also removes the need for putting a caching layer inside an application\n",
    "\n",
    "In-memory datastores and caches:\n",
    "* Decrease access latency - frequently accessed data but rarely updated\n",
    "* Increase throughput - retrieving from disk is always slower and more expensive than finding a key in a key-value pair cache\n",
    "* Ease the load off databases and applications - queries using multiple tables and/or performing multiple calculations are expensive\n",
    "    * By caching results the cost of the query is incurred once\n",
    "    * Data can be returned multiple times without needing to run the query again\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk of loss:\n",
    "* As In-memory data store keeps the entire dataset in RAM, not on disk, the reward is speed however if the machine goes down, the data will be lost.\n",
    "* Some In-Memory stores like Redis, are able to add persistence for recovery by saving a transaction log to disk and taking snapshots of datasets stored in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cached data is stale data - can the application can tolerate stale data and in what context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: stock prices displayed to a customer may have a tolerance to staleness of 5 minutes.<br>\n",
    "&emsp;However a stockbroker would want prices in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching should provide a speed or cost advantage.<br>\n",
    "It does not make sense to cache data that is dynamic or that is rarely accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For caching to provide a benefit, data should be relatively static and frequently accessed like a personal profile on a social media site.\n",
    "\n",
    "An in-memory store is well-suited to be a front-end for relational databases and key-value stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can provide a high-performance middle tier for applications having high request rates or low-latency requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In-memory stores can be used to cache session data, web pages, and leaderboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can provide a high-performance middle tier for applications having high request rates or low-latency requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In-memory stores can be used to cache session data, web pages, and leaderboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph databases\n",
    "A Graph database is a database that uses a graphical model to represent and store data about relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship data is important for things including:\n",
    "* Building social network applications,\n",
    "* Recommendation engines,\n",
    "* Fraud detection,\n",
    "* Creating knowledge graphs,\n",
    "* Modeling life sciences\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS managed NoSQL graph database is Amazon Neptune.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Graph database?\n",
    "There are 3 properties that make a graph database:\n",
    "* Vertices\n",
    "* Edges\n",
    "* Properties.\n",
    "\n",

    "e.g. scaling up from a m4.large to an m4.2xlarge\n",
    "\n",
    "At any point you can scale your RDS database vertically, changing the size of the instance.\n",

    "* NoSQL database\n",
    "* Uses Key-value stores\n",
    "    * Collection of items/records. \n",
    "    * Data can be looked up via:\n",
    "        * Primary key for each item\n",
    "        * Through the use of indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Designed for ultra high performance, maintained at any scale with single-digit latency.<br>\n",
    "This is a very powerful database choice used commonly for gaming, web, mobile, and IoT applications.<br>\n",
    "DynamoDB is a fully managed service - backups and patching is managed by AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a DynamoDB database\n",
    "1. Set up tables\n",
    "2. Copnfigure provision throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "Provision thoughput refers to the level of read and write capacity that you want AWS to reserve for your table.<br>\n",
    "You are charged for the total amount of throughput that you configure for your tables plus the total amount of storage used by your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "DynamoDB tables are considered schemaless as there is no strict design nor schema that every record must conform to.<br>\n",
    "As long as each item has an appropriate primary key, the item can contain varying sets of attributes.<br>\n",
    "The records in a table do not need to have the same attributes or even the same number of attributes.<br>\n",
    "This can be convenient for rapid application development and if you wanted to add a new column to a table, you don not need to alter the table, you can just start including the new field as an attribute when you insert new records.<br>\n",
    "Likewise, you never need to adjust the data type for a column as DynamoDB is not interested in data types for individual attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-default table settings\n",
    "### Secondary indexes\n",
    "Secondary indexes allow users to perform quesies on attributes that are not part of the table's primary key.<br>\n",
    "DynamoDB allows additional indexed so queries can be ran to search for data by other attributes.\n",
    "1. Each query can only use one index. Querying and matching on two different columns requires an index that can do that properly.\n",
    "2. When writing queries, they need to specify exactly which index sgould be used for each query. Unlike relationa databases, there is no query analyser which can decide which indexes to use for the query. Queries need to be explicit and tell DynamoDB what index to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "DynamoDB has two different kinds of secondary indexes:\n",
    "1. Global - Allows queries across the entire table to find any record that matches a particular value.\n",
    "2. Local - Only finds data within a single partition key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Read/write capacity mode\n",
    "When creating a table in DynamoDB, you need to tell AWS how much capacity you want to reserve for the table.<br>\n",
    "Amazon charges you based on the number of read capacity units and write capacity units that are allocated.<br>\n",
    "It is important to allocate enough for the workload, but over allocation may be very costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two modes to choose from:\n",
    "* Provisioned\n",
    "    * Allows provision set read and writes allowed against your database per second by the application\n",
    "    * Measured in capacity units (RCU, WCU). Depending on the transaction, each action will use 1 or more RCUs/WCUs.\n",
    "    * Used generally when there is a predicted and forecasted workload of traffic.\n",
    "* On-demand\n",
    "    * Does not provision any RCUs or WCUs, instead they are scaled on demand. It is not as cost effective as provisioned.\n",
    "    * Generally used if you do not know how much workload you are expected to experience.\n",
    "    * With more understanding of load, you can then change mode across to Provisioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Auto scaling\n",
    "On provisioned mode, you can configure how RCU and WCU are scaled as demand increases/decreases.<br>\n",
    "Enter the minimum and maximum provisioned capacity along with the target threshold utlisation as a percentage, you can rely on Amazon DynamoDB to manage the scaling operations of your throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encryption at rest\n",
    "Encryption, by default for data at rest.<br>\n",
    "Through the use of the Key Management Service (KMS), you are able to select either a customer managed or AWS managed CMK to use for the encryption of the tables instead of the default keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DynamoDB advantages\n",
    "* Fully managed\n",
    "    * Back-ups and patching is managed by AWS.\n",
    "    * Though custom safeguards are available.\n",
    "* Schemaless\n",
    "    * Does not require planning in advance.\n",
    "    * Data model can change automatically to fit the needs of the application.\n",
    "* Highly available\n",
    "    * Data is replicated over 3 availablity zones.\n",
    "* Fast\n",
    "    * Millisecond read/write speeds independant of the size of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DynamoDB disadvantages\n",
    "* Eventual consistency\n",
    "    * Replication may take longer than expect\n",
    "    * This may lead to queries and table scans retrieving older versions of the data before the most recent copy.\n",
    "* Queries less flexible than SQL\n",
    "    * Unable to use advanced queries with joins, groupings, and summaries.\n",
    "    * This is done via computation in the application code.\n",
    "* Workflow limitations\n",
    "    * Maximum record size: 400 kilobytes.\n",
    "    * Maximum indexes per table: 20 global, 5 secondary.\n",
    "* Provisioned throughput\n",
    "    * DynamoDB performacne can scale up as needs grow, performance is limited to the amount of read/write throughput provisioned for each table.\n",
    "    * If there is a spike in database use, throughput needs to be provisioned in advance or database requests will fail with a `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` message.\n",
    "    * Though throughput can be adjusted at any time and only takes a couple of minutes, it still requires monitoring or the risk running out of throughput as usage grows."

    "A fast, fully-managed petabute-scale data warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operates as a Relaional Database Management System (RDMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on PostgreSQL 8.0.2 but contains a number of differences from PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a data warehouse?\n",
    "A data warehouse is used to consolidate data from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This aggregation of data can be used with business intelligent tools, across the data, to help identify actionable business information.<br>\n",
    "This can be used to direct and drive the organisation to make effective data-drive decisions to the benefit of the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a data warehouse is an effective way to manage reporting and data analysis at scale.<br>\n",
    "A data warehouse therefore needs to store huge amounts of data.<br>\n",
    "The data may be subjected to different data operations such as data cleansing, which as an example, may identify, correct, replace, or remove incomplete records from a table or recordset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be expanded upon for the need to perform an extract, transform, and load (ETL) job.<br>\n",
    "This is the common paradigm by which data from multiple systems are combined to a single database, data store, or warehouse for legacy storage or analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extraction is the process of retrieving data from one or more sources.<br>\n",
    "Either online, brick and mortar, legacy data, Salesforce data, and many others.<br>\n",
    "After retrieving the data, ETL is to compute work that loads it into a staging area and prepares it for the next phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform is the process of mapping, reformatting, conforming, adding meaning and more to prepare the data in a way that is more easily consumed.<br>\n",
    "One example of this is the transformation and computation where currency amounts are converted from US dollars to Euros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading involves successfully inserting the transform data into the target database, data store, or in this case, a data warehouse.<br>\n",
    "All this work is processed in what the business intelligence developers call an ETL job.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "A cluster can be considered the main or core component of the Amazon Redshift service.<br>\n",
    "In every cluster, it will run its own Redshift engine, which will contain at least one database.<br>\n",
    "As the name implies, a cluster is a grouping of compute nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cluster will contain at least one compute note.<br>\n",
    "If the cluster is provisioned with more than one compute node, then Amazon redshift will add another componenet called a leader node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute nodes contain their own quantity of CPU, attached storage, and memory.<br>\n",
    "There are different nodes that offer different performances.<br>\n",
    "Leader nodes of the cluster coordinate communication between the compute nodes in the cluster and the external applications accessing the Redshift data warehouse.<br>\n",
    "The leader node is the gateway into the clusters from applications.<br>\n",
    "When external applications are querying the data in the warehouse, the leader node will create execution plans, containing code to return the required results from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a query from the external application references tables associated with the compute nodes, then this code is then distributed to the compute nodes in the cluster to obtain the required data, which is then sent back to the leader node.<br>\n",
    "If the query does not reference tables stored on the compute nodes, then the query will only run on the leader node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each compute node itself is also split into splices, known as node slices.<br>\n",
    "A node slice is simply a partition of a compute node where the nodes memory and disk spaces split.<br>\n",
    "Each node slice then processes operations given by the leader node where parallel operations can then be performed across all slices and all nodes at oncefor the same query.<br>\n",
    "Compute nodes can have different capacities and these capacities determine how many slices each compute node can be split into.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon creating of the Amazon Redshift database, it will need to connect to applications.<br>\n",
    "These are typically the analytic and buisiness intelligence tools of the organisation.<br>\n",
    "Communication between the BI applications and Redshift will use industry standard Open DataBase Connectivity (OCBC), and Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) for PostreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Undestanding Performance\n",
    "Amazon Redshift is 3x faster than other cloud data warehouses.<br>\n",
    "Amazon Redshift has a number of features to return results quickly and effectively, including:\n",
    "1. Massive Parallel Processing (MPP)\n",
    "    * By associating rows from tables across a number of nodes slices and nodes, it allows the node leader to generate execution plans, to distribute crews from external applications across multiple compute nodes at once, allowing them to work together to generate the end result, which is aggregated by the leader node.\n",
    "2. Columnar Data Storage\n",
    "    * This is used as a way of reducing the number of times the database has to perform disk I/O, which helps to enhance query performance. Reducing the data retrievals from the disk means there is more memory capacity to carry out in memory processing of the query results. \n",
    "3. Result Caching\n",
    "    * Caching in general is a great way to implement a level of optimisation. Result caching helps reduce the time it takes to carry out queries by caching some results of the queries in the memory of the leader node in a cluster. As a result, when a query is submitted, the leader node will check its own cache copy of the results and if a successful match is found, the cached results are used instead of executing another query on your Redshift cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Redshift intergrates with Amazon CloudWatch.<br>\n",
    "This allows monitoring performance of physical resources (CPU utilisation, throughput).<br>\n",
    "Redshift generates query and load performance data that enables tracking of overall database performance.<br>\n",
    "Any data relating to query and load performance is only accessible from within the Redshift console itself, not Amazon CloudWatch."
