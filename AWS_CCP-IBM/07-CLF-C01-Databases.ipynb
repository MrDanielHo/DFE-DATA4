    "The 3 main services:\n",
    "* Compute\n",
    "* Storage\n",
    "* Database\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foundation of Application Development\n",
    "There are 2 primary types of databases:\n",
    "* Relational\n",
    "* Non-relational\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relational\n",
    "* Sometimes called SQL databases\n",
    "* They use the Structured Query Language to manage information storage and retrieval\n",
    "* Commercially available since the 1970s\n",
    "* Optimised around storage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-relational databases\n",
    "* Popularised in the 21st century as web development had a need to process unstructured and semi-structured data\n",
    "* Often distributed databases where data is stored on multiple computers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Databases defined\n",
    "A database is any type of mechanism used for storing, managing, and retrieving information.<br>\n",
    "It is a repository or collection of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are nine primary categories of databases available on AWS\n",
    "1. Relational\n",
    "2. Key-value \n",
    "3. Document\n",
    "4. In-memory stores\n",
    "5. Graph\n",
    "6. Columnar\n",
    "7. Time series\n",
    "8. Quantum ledger\n",
    "9. Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Matching the application and the type of database is essential for performance and costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The promise of the cloud\n",
    "The cloud promises agility - being able to respond to changes in a business environment as they happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes the ability to grow when needed - scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another promise is elasticity - the ability to scale up with increase in demand AND to scale down with decrease in demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Picking the correct database\n",
    "Things to consider include:\n",
    "* Size\n",
    "* Shape\n",
    "* Computational requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The above determines what type of database is needed for the application to allow for scalability and elasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "An application may use multiple databases - each serving a unique purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workload types\n",
    "### Operational\n",
    "Operational applications are the ones often referred to as Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "OLTP is centered around a set of common business processes that is regular, repeatable, and durable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include: e-commerce, content mangement system, or information management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data goes in, reports come out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database in the back end is generally relational, as the data is structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical\n",
    "Online Analytics Processiong (OLAP) applications are used for things like business intelligence workloads and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to gain insight, the types are:\n",
    "* Retrospective analytics - examining the history of the organisation\n",
    "* Streaming - gathering data in real time to discover trends or raise alarms\n",
    "* Predictive - using past data to predict the future - starting to use Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence\n"

    "# Relational Databases\n",
    "Relational databases provide an efficient, intuitive, and flexible way to store and report on highly structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These structures are called scheme and they are defined before any data can be entered into the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reporting requirement drive database design\n",
    "Schemas are designed and built around reporting requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases' expected output drives the creation of the database and how data is stored inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the schema has been defined, database admins and programmers work backward from these requirements to define how data will be stored inside the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "No data can be stored in a database until this work has been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing schemas to exisiting databases are expensive in terms of time and compute power.<br>\n",
    "It also runs the risk of corrupting data and breaking exisiting reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling data\n",
    "In relational databases, data is stored in tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each table or relation, contains one or more rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row or record, contains a collection of logically related data that is identified by a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data stored in a row are called attributes or fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually a table looks like a spreedsheet - rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "One column of each table contains a primary key that uniquely identifies the information stored in each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationships between tables are created using primary keys.<br>\n",
    "The primary key for one table is a foreign key for another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Integrity\n",
    "Data intergrity is of concert in relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of constraints that ensure the data contained in tables is reliable and accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "These reliability features are referred to ACID transactions:\n",
    "* Atomicity - refers to the elements that make up a single database transaction. A transaction can have multiple parts in multiple tables. It is treated as a single unit - either it succeeds or fails completely.\n",
    "* Consistency - refers to the database's state. Transactions must take the database from one valid state to another valid state.\n",
    "* Isolation - prevetns one transaction from interfering with another.\n",
    "* Durability - ensures that data changes become permanent once the transaction is committed to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keys and data integrity\n",
    "As part of the requirements to maintain database stability, Primary keys and Foreign keys are constraint (have rules that govern them), to ensure the integrity of database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity Integrity ensures that the primary key is unique to the table and is not NULL or blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential Integrity requires every Foreign key column exists as the Primary key of its originating table.<br>\n",
    "If four tables are related and a record is deleted in one of them, then the corresponding records in related tables must be deleted as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structured Query Language\n",
    "The standard user and Application Programming Interface (API) of relational databases is Structured Query Language (SQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be used interactively or programmatically to create, update, and maintain the data inside a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data access controls\n",
    "Relational database engines have built-in features for securing and protecting data but planning and effort are required to properly implement them:\n",
    "* Authentication\n",
    "* Authorisation\n",
    "* Audit logging\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data normalisation\n",
    "As part of the structure, data stored in relational databases is highly normalised.<br>\n",
    "Normalisation is a process where information is organised efficiently and consistently before storing it.\n",
    "* Duplicated is discarded\n",
    "* Closely related fields are grouped together\n",
    "\n",
    "Data should be stored one time a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields that a logically related (e.g. first name and last name) should be stored in the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing redundancy and keeping similar data close reduces storage costs and improves the efficiency of data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scaling and sharding\n",
    "Relational databases are not partition tolerant.<br>\n",
    "A data partition in this case, refers to the storage disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding another disk would be like creating a second copy of the database.<br>\n",
    "This copy or partition, is called a shard.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a shard is created, it uses the original database's schema<br>\n",
    "This is a horizontal partition of a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For it to function, logic outside of the database must be created to direct queries to the correct database.<br>\n",
    "This is because Relational databases are designed to only validate how data is stored.<br>\n",
    "They do not see if information belongs inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this complexity, databases are scaled vertically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal scaling adds a copy of the database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertical scaling is growing the server; usually by adding memory, CPU, or expanding a disk volume.<br>\n",
    "There are limitaions - only so many resource will fit inside a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these limits have been reached, a database will either need to be redesigned or broken into shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AWS Relational Database Engines\n",
    "AWS has 6 full-mananged database engines inside the Relational Database Service (RDS).\n",
    "* Amazon Aurora - AWS' cloud-native version of MySQL and Postgres\n",
    "* MySQL\n",

    "# NoSQL Databases\n",
    "Relational databases are highly structured repositories of data.<br>\n",
    "They use schemas to define how information is organised and the schema must exist before that database can be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fixed nature of data structures makes relational databases sub-optimal for analytical processes where data is semi-structured or unstructured.\n",
    "\n",
    "While relational databases are highly-structured repositories of information, non-relational databases do not use a fixed table structure.<br>\n",
    "They are schema-less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it does not use a predefined schema that is enforced by a database engine, a non-relational database can use structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data without difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NoSQL\n",
    "NoSQL is a general term referring to a particular type of database model.<Br>\n",
    "It encompasses a wide variety of different models that do not fit into the relational model.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL describes a family of schema-less non-relational, distributed data stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are popular with developers because they do not require an upfront schema design they are able to build code without having a database to be designed and built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this flexibility, a dynamic approach to organising data, that has been popular with companies needing to store unstructured or rapidly changing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is in a name?\n",
    "Initially, it described databases that used mechanisms other than SQL to manage data.<br>\n",
    "The NoSQL can be defined in 2 ways:\n",
    "* There was \"No SQL\" used when accessing and manipulating data\n",
    "* The definition has been expanded to mean \"Not Only SQL\". Some systems use SQL along with other technologies and query languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of NoSQL Databases\n",
    "* Non-relational\n",
    "    * Relational database model might not be a good for an application's requirements\n",
    "    * Data might be unstructured or semi-structured - the amount of data might be impractical for a relational database\n",
    "    * Data might be of one type and does not require the controls that come with relational databases\n",
    "* Open-source\n",
    "    * Not a requirement - there are many relational and non-relational databases that are not open source\n",
    "    * Developers of NoSQL lean towards providing open-source solutions\n",
    "* Schema-less\n",
    "    * Schemas can be created dynamically as data is accessed or even embedded into the data itself\n",
    "    * NoSQL databases have a reputation for being more flexible with the data they can accept and support agile and DevOps philosophies\n",
    "* Horizontally scalable\n",
    "    * NoSQL databases are often run in clusters of computing nodes\n",
    "    * Data is partitioned across multiple computers so that each computer can perform a specific task independently of the others\n",
    "    * Each node performs its task without having o share CPU, memory, or storage with nodes\n",
    "    * This is known as shard-nothing architecture\n",
    "* Does not adhere to ACID constraints\n",
    "    * Most NoSQL databases relax ACID constraints\n",
    "    * Most NoSQL solutions were developed around the purpose of providing high availability and scalability in a distributed environment\n",
    "    * To do this, either consistency or durability must be sacrificed. By relaxing consistency, distributed systems can be highly avilable and durable\n",
    "    * Using a NoSQL approach, inconsistent data is expected. This must be recognised and managed appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "Most NoSQL databases access data using their own Application Programming Interface (API).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some NoSQL databases use a subset of SQL for data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there is no standard query language that is suported by all NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some may have their own query language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Others support languages including:\n",
    "* JavaScript,\n",
    "* Java\n",
    "* Python\n",
    "* Xquery\n",
    "* SPARQL\n",
    "\n",
    "## A family of databases\n",
    "* Key-value - simplest NoSQL \n",
    "    * Using RESTful API a client can:\n",
    "        * `get` the value for a key\n",
    "        * `put` a value for a key\n",
    "        * `delete` a key from the data\n",
    "* Document\n",
    "    * Uses a document to store information\n",
    "    * Data is semi-structured and can be queried\n",
    "    * Schema is built into the document itself\n",
    "    * It is different from key-value as values can be nested and can be indexed and retrieved        \n",
    "* Graph\n",
    "    * Uses a graphical model to represent and store information\n",
    "    * Uses Vertices and Edges\n",
    "* Column family stores\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "Scaling is easier and cheaper as they can be scaled horizontally - adding compute node or disk node.<br>\n",
    "Where relational databases are scaled vertically - adding CPU, memory, storage, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL trades consistency for performance and scalability.<br>\n",
    "Relational databases adhere to ACID."

    "# Types of Managed NoSQL on AWS\n",
    "## Key-value stores\n",
    "Relational Databases:\n",
    "* Data stored in tables - rows and columns\n",
    "* Tables and types of data are defined before development\n",
    "* Storage and access patterns are optimised\n",
    "* Inflexible\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value Databases/Stores:\n",
    "* Considered simplest type of NoSQL database\n",
    "* Typically more flexible than Relational and offers fast performance for read/writes\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS managed NoSQL database that is a Key-value store is DynamoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value stores are designed for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays and are well suited for working with large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An associative array, also known as a dictionary or hash table, stores data with a unique identifier called a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data stored, one or more items, is the value.<br>\n",
    "This can include:\n",
    "* Text\n",
    "* Numbers\n",
    "* Lists\n",
    "* Documents\n",
    "* Another key-value pair\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is stored and retrieved using operations such as:\n",
    "* `get`\n",
    "* `put`\n",
    "* `delete`\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries to key-value stores are simple.<br>\n",
    "Lookups are based on the key and retrieval is often measured in milliseconds regardless of the size of the data returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value stores are not optimised for search.<br>\n",
    "It is very expensive to scan in terms of time and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are not suitable for applications requiring frequent updates or complex queries involving specific data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use case\n",
    "* Web applications storing user profiles\n",
    "* Shopping cart data\n",
    "* Preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time recommendation engines and advertising systems are often powered by key-value stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value stores are commonly used for in-memory data caching.<br>\n",
    "They can speed up applications by minimising reads and writes to slower disk-based systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary objects (pictures and other multimedia), can be stored in key-value databases.<br>\n",
    "However a better solution (in regards to time and cost), is to save binary files in object storage and use a key-value database for lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document stores\n",
    "DynamoDB is a key-value database.<br>\n",
    "Since it can store key-value pairs as a value, it is also a type of NoSQL Document database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document databases were invented to store semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of having the structured defined as part of the database in advance like a relational database each document in the database has its own unique schema that defines its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS managed NoSQL document database service is Amazon DocumentDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a document database, Amazon DocumentDB is designed to store, query, and index JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document databases are similar to key-value databases - they both use key-values.<br>\n",
    "The difference is that the values in a document database, contain structured or semi-structured data referred to as a Document.\n",
    "\n",
    "In semi-structured data, there is no separation between the schema and the data.<br>\n",
    "Each document stored has its own unique schema that defines what it contains.<br>\n",
    "The database engine uses this structure of the stored data to create metadata that is used for database optimisation and queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document stores scale horizontally - data can be stored over multiple (1000+) nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit that Document Store databases have over Key-value databases is that, in document stores, the data inside the document can be queried.<br>\n",
    "This is different from a Key-value store where a query returns the value in its entirety.<br>\n",
    "In a Document Store, queries can be run against the structure of a document as well as the elements inside it to return only the information required.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases include:\n",
    "* Web applications\n",
    "* User-generated content\n",
    "* Shopping catalogs\n",
    "* Gaming\n",
    "* IoT devices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Column family stores\n",
    "A Column Store, stores data using a column-oriented model.\n",
    "\n",
    "On AWS, the NoSQL column store available is the managed service, Amazon Keyspaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using columns allows databases to precisely access data needed to answer a query without having to scan each row in a table and discard unwanted items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column stores can referred to as:\n",
    "* Column databases\n",
    "* Column-family databases\n",
    "* Column-oriented databases\n",
    "* Wide-column stores\n",
    "* Columnar databases\n",
    "* Columnar stores\n",
    "\n",
    "### The structure of a column store database\n",
    "Column store databases uses a concept called keyspace to define the data it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "A keyspace is similar to a relational database's schema.<br>\n",
    "The keyspace contains a collection of column families that look like tables from a relational database.<br>\n",
    "The column families contain rows and these rows contain columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Column Family consists of multiple rows.<br>\n",
    "Each row can contain a number of different columns.<br>\n",
    "Each column is limited to its row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns are kept in their own row.<br>\n",
    "They do not span all rows like a relational database does.<br>\n",
    "Each column contains a name-value pair along with a timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "A row is constructed with a row key and one or more columns.<br>\n",
    "The row key is a unique identifier for that row.<br>\n",
    "Each column contains a name-value pair and a timestamp.<br>\n",
    "The timestamp is the date and time the data was inserted.<br>\n",
    "This is often used to detemine the most recent version of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "Columns stores are:\n",
    "* Efficient doing data compression and partitioning\n",
    "* Due to their structure, columnar databases excel at doing aggregation-type queries\n",
    "* They can SUM, COUNT, and AVG values\n",
    "\n",
    "Columnar databases scale well.<br>\n",
    "Suited for workloads that do Massively Parallel Processing where data is spread across a large cluster of compute nodes that could number 1000s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Columnar stores can be loaded fast and efficiently.<br>\n",
    "A one-billion row table can be loaded into a columnar store in seconds with queries and analysis starting almost immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an end-user perspective, the metadata in a columnar database looks and feels like a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some columnar database engines are SQL compliant and support the same controls that maintain the data's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases:\n",
    "* Analytical applications\n",
    "* Data warehousing\n",
    "* Big data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "## In-memory stores\n",
    "In-memory data stores are used by applications that require real-time access to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since data is stored in memory, it provides microsecond latency to applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "These stores are used as caches and the managed NoSQL service available from AWS is Amazon ElastiCache.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon ElastiCache has 2 no NoSQL In-memory database engines:\n",
    "* Redis\n",
    "* Memcached\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:<br>\n",
    "* A caching system is not a database. It is something that sits in front of a database to improve throughput\n",
    "* It also removes the need for putting a caching layer inside an application\n",
    "\n",
    "In-memory datastores and caches:\n",
    "* Decrease access latency - frequently accessed data but rarely updated\n",
    "* Increase throughput - retrieving from disk is always slower and more expensive than finding a key in a key-value pair cache\n",
    "* Ease the load off databases and applications - queries using multiple tables and/or performing multiple calculations are expensive\n",
    "    * By caching results the cost of the query is incurred once\n",
    "    * Data can be returned multiple times without needing to run the query again\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk of loss:\n",
    "* As In-memory data store keeps the entire dataset in RAM, not on disk, the reward is speed however if the machine goes down, the data will be lost.\n",
    "* Some In-Memory stores like Redis, are able to add persistence for recovery by saving a transaction log to disk and taking snapshots of datasets stored in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cached data is stale data - can the application can tolerate stale data and in what context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: stock prices displayed to a customer may have a tolerance to staleness of 5 minutes.<br>\n",
    "&emsp;However a stockbroker would want prices in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching should provide a speed or cost advantage.<br>\n",
    "It does not make sense to cache data that is dynamic or that is rarely accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For caching to provide a benefit, data should be relatively static and frequently accessed like a personal profile on a social media site.\n",
    "\n",
    "An in-memory store is well-suited to be a front-end for relational databases and key-value stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can provide a high-performance middle tier for applications having high request rates or low-latency requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In-memory stores can be used to cache session data, web pages, and leaderboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can provide a high-performance middle tier for applications having high request rates or low-latency requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In-memory stores can be used to cache session data, web pages, and leaderboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph databases\n",
    "A Graph database is a database that uses a graphical model to represent and store data about relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship data is important for things including:\n",
    "* Building social network applications,\n",
    "* Recommendation engines,\n",
    "* Fraud detection,\n",
    "* Creating knowledge graphs,\n",
    "* Modeling life sciences\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS managed NoSQL graph database is Amazon Neptune.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Graph database?\n",
    "There are 3 properties that make a graph database:\n",
    "* Vertices\n",
    "* Edges\n",
    "* Properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertices or Nodes are objects such as people or artifacts.<br>\n",
    "Each node in a graph database has a unique identifier expressed in key-value pairs.<br>\n",

    "## Time series databases\n",
    "Time-series databases efficiently collect, synthesize and derive insights from data that changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS managed NoSQL database for time-stream data is Amazon Timestream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is stored as the value, at regular intervals with the timestamp as the key.<br>\n",
    "While it is possible to retrieve a single item from time-series data, computation is usually applied over a range of time data to return a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of a Time-series database is to provide answers.<br>\n",
    "A query will process a range of data, do the appropriate computations, and return the results.<br>\n",
    "E.g. determining the MIN, MAX, AVG CPU utilisation on a server over the past week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-series databases are ideal for DevOps applications that collect data millions of times per second and analyse that data in real time to improve application performance and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Time-series databases to quickly analyze time-series data generated by IoT applications using analytic functions such as smoothing, approximation, and interpolation.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Ledger databases\n",
    "Ledger databases provide a centralised and trusted authority to maintain a scalable, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable record of transactions for an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS managed NoSQL database for ledger database is the Amazon Quantum Ledger Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Ledger DataBases (QLDBs) are immutable.<br>\n",
    "The data in the database remains unchanged once saved.<br>\n",
    "The action of updating data creates a new version of the record.<br>\n",
    "Changes to the database do not overwrite exisitng database records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic verification is used to ensure data is immutable.<br>\n",
    "When a record is committed, a hash is created by the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is an algorithm performed on data to produce a checksum or hash.<br>\n",
    "This hash is used to verify data has not been modified, tampered with, or corrupt.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how many times the hashing algorithm is run against the data, the hash will always be the same when the data is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "QLDB use blockchain technology when creating hashes.<br>\n",
    "They use two pieces of information to create the hash value:\n",
    "* the record data, and\n",
    "* the hash of the previous record.\n",
    "This ensures that the entire chain of records is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone can create an audit log to show how data is used, but how can they legally prove that the data has not been altered?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the best user interfaces and audit tracking, a skilled programming can change electronic records without leaving a trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blockchains can be used to build trust and ensure policy, governance, and regulation of data processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cases\n",
    "* Finance \n",
    "    * Banks often need a centralised ledger-like application to keep track of critical data such as credit and debit card transactions.\n",
    "    * Instead of building a custom ledger with complicated auditing functionality, a ledger database can easily store an accurate and complete record of financial transactions.\n",
    "* Manufacturing\n",
    "    * Manufacturing companies have a need to reconsile data between supply chain systems to track the manufacturing history of a product.\n",
    "    * A ledger database can be used to record the history of each transaction and provide the details of each individual batch of a product manufactured at a facility.\n",
    "* Insurance\n",
    "    * Insurance applications need a way to track the history of claims.\n",
    "    * Instead of building complex auditing functionality using relational databases, insurance companies can use a ledgeer database to maintain the history of claims.\n",
    "    * When conflicts arise, a ledger database can cryptographically verify the integrity of the claims data.\n",
    "* Human Resources:\n",
    "    * HR systems have to track and maintain a record of employee details such as payroll, bonus, benefits, performance history, and insurance.\n",
    "    * By implementing a system-of-record application using a ledger database, companies can easily maintain a trusted and complete record of the digital history of emplotees in a single place.\n",
    "* Retail\n",
    "    * Retailers need to access information on eah stage of a product's supply chain.\n",
    "    * With a ledger database, retail companies can track the full history of inventory and supply chain transactions.\n",

    "* Full-text search\n",
    "* Complex search expressions\n",
    "* Ranking of search results\n",
    "\n",
    "The managed NoSQL offering from AWS is the Amazon OpenSearch.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenSearch uses a data structure called an inverted index that provides fast full-text searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents where each work occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search databases can be used to store, analyse, and correlate application and infrastructure log data to find and fix issues.\n",
