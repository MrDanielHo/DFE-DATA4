    "# What is Decoupled and Event-Driven Architecture?\n",
    "## Monolithic Architecture\n",
    "Monolithic Applications are essentially tightly coupled together and had a lot of built in dependencies against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when changes to the front-end or back-end of an application would affect the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decouple Architecture\n",
    "By using a decoupled architecture you are building a solution put together using different components and services that can operate and execute independently of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each service within a decoupled environment communicates with others using specific interfaces which remain constant throughout its development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Event-Driven Architecture\n",
    "Services in an event-driven architecture are triggered by events that occur within the infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an event?\n",
    "* Change of state\n",
    "    * An EC2 instance changing from running to stopped\n",
    "    * An item has been moved from sale to sold\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically 3 components:\n",
    "1. Producer - is the element within the infrastructure that will push an even to the event router\n",
    "2. Event router - then processes the event and takes the necessary action in pushing the outcome to the consumers\n",
    "3. Consumer - executes the appropriate action as requested"

    "# Simple Queue Service (SQS)\n",
    "It is a service that handles the delivery of messages between components\n",
    "\n",
    "SQS is a fully managed service that works with serverless systems, microservices, and distributed architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has the capability of sending, storing, and receiving messages at scale without dropping message data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to configure the service using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visibility Timeout\n",
    "When a message is retrieved by a consumer, the visibility timeout is started.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the time is 30 seconds but can be set to as long as 12 hours before the consumer should take action.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this period, the consumer will not send a delete message back to SQS.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result if the visibility timeout expires and it does not receive the request to delete the message, the message will become available again in the queue for other consumers to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The message will then appear as a new message to the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQS Queue Types\n",
    "* Standard Queues - support at-least-once delivery of messages\n",
    "    * They offer a best effort on trying to preserve the message ordering\n",
    "    * They provide almost unlimited number of transactions per second (TPS)\n",
    "* First-In-First-Out Queues - order of messages is maintained and there are not duplicates\n",
    "    * Limited number of transactions per second (defaulted to 300 TPS)\n",
    "    * Batching allows you to perform actions agaisnt 10 messages at once with a single action\n",
    "* Dead-Letter Queues - sends messages that fail to be processed\n",
    "    * This could be a result of code within your application, corruption within the message, or simply missing information\n",
    "    * If the mssage cannot be processed by a consumer after a maximum number of tries specified, the queue will send the message to a DQL\n",
    "    * By viewing and analysing the content of the message it might be possible to identify the problem and ascertain the source of the issue\n",
    "    * The DLQ must have the same queue type as the source it is used against\n",
    "        * Standard Queue must use Standard Dead-Letter Queue\n",
    "        * FIFO Queue must use FIFO Dead-Letter Queue"

    "# Simple Notification Service (SNS)\n",
    "SNS is used as publish/subscribe messaging service.\n",
    "\n",
    "SNS is centred around topics.<br>\n",
    "Think of topics as groups for collecting message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users or endpoints can subscribe to these topics, where message or events are published.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a message is published, ALL subscribers to that topic receive a notification of that message.\n",
    "\n",
    "SNS us a managed service and highly scable, allowing the distribution of messages automatically to all subscribers across the environment, including mobiles users.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be configured with the AWS management console, the CLI, or with the AWS SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SNS Topics\n",
    "SNS uses the concept of publishers and subscribers.<br>\n",
    "In SQS terms, publishers are producers and subscribers are consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Publishers send messages to a topic, the central communication control point.<br>\n",
    "Subscribers of the topic are notified of the message by:\n",
    "* HTTP\n",
    "* HTTPS\n",
    "* Email\n",
    "* Email-JSON\n",
    "* SQS\n",
    "* Application\n",
    "* Lambda\n",
    "* SMS\n",
    "\n",
    "Subscribers are not limited to users.<br>\n",
    "For example, it could be a web server and it is notified via the HTTP protocol.<br>\n",
    "Or if it was a user, they are notified by email.\n",
    "\n",
    "SNS offers methods of controlling specific access to the topics through a topic policy.<br>\n",
    "For example, you can restrict which protocol subscribers can use.<br>\n",
    "That is, users only receiving SMS or HTTPS or allowing access to topics to specific users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy follows the same format as IAM policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SNS and SQS\n",
    "By working together, a solution can be designed to send messages to subscribers through a push method, while SQS handles incoming messages and waits for consumers to Pull data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Invoker Lambda functions with SNS\n",
    "SNS notifications can invoke existing Lambda functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lambda function must be subscribed to the Topic so the messages are pushed to the Lambda function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function itself uses the payload of the message as an input parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can then alter the message if required or forward the message on to other AWS services or indeed another SNS topic."

    "# Amazon Kinesis\n",
    "Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyse real-time streaming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Kinesis does nto store persistent data itself, unlike many of the other Amazon big data services.<br>\n",
    "It needs to be deployed as part of a larger event-driven solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Kinesis provides three different solution capabilities:\n",
    "* Amazon Kinesis Streams - This enables you to build custom applications that process or analyse streaming data for specialised needs.\n",
    "    * Kinesis Data Streams - A data streaming service capable of elastically scaling to support thousands of data feeds.\n",
    "    * Kinesis Video Streams - Designed to securely elastically scale and ingest video streams on a massive scale.\n",
    "* Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose - Enables you to load streaming data into Amazon Kinesis analytics, Amazon S3, Amazon RedShift, and Amazon Elastic Search and Splunk.\n",
    "* Amazon Kinesis Analytics - Enables you to write standard SQL queries on streaming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Amazon Kinesis Streams\n",
    "You determine the throughput of the capacity you require, and the architecture and components are automatically provisioned and stored and configured for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Amazon Kinesis Stream is an ordered sequence of data records:\n",
    "* A record is the unit of data in an Amazon Kinesis stream\n",
    "* Each record in the stream is composed of:\n",
    "    * A sequence number\n",
    "    * A partition key\n",
    "    * A data blob - is the data of interest that your data producer adds to a stream\n",
    "        * A producer is an entity that is continuously pushing data to Kinesis Streams, for example a web service sending log data to a stream is a producer.\n",
    "        * A consumer receives records from Amazon Kinesis Streams and processes them in real-time.\n",
    "            * These are known as Amazon Kinesis Streams applications and typically run on a fleet of EC2 instances.\n",
    "            * You need to build your applications using either the Amazon Kinesis API or the Amazon Kinesis Client Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Amazon Kinesis Firehose\n",
    "Amazon Kinesis Firehose is a fully-managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as Amazon S3, Amazon RedShift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service and Splunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Kinesis Firehose you do not need to write applications as the consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure Amazon Kinesis Firehose to transform the data before data delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Kinesis Firehose by creating a Firehose delivery stream and then sending data to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each delivery stream is effectively defined by the target system that receives the streamed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firehose can invoke an AWS Lambda function to transform incoming data before delivering it to the selected destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure a new Lambda function using one of the Lambda blueprints AWS provides or choosing an existing Lambda function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference between Firehose and Streams\n",
    "Amazon Kinesis Streams is a service for workloads that require custom processing, per incoming record, with sub-one-second processing latency, and a choice of stream processing frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a service for workloads that require zero administration.<br>\n",
    "You do not have to create a stream or create a custom application as the destination.<br>\n",
    "Firehose is limited to S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch and Splunk as the data destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Amazon Kinesis Analyics\n",
    "Amazon Kinesis Analytics enables you to quickly author SQL code that continuously reads, processes, and stores data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can ingest in real-time billions of small data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each individual data point can then be aggregated to provide intelligent business insights, which in turn can be used to continually optimise and improve business processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinesis Analytics requires you to perform three steps:\n",
    "1. Create an input stream - Input streams typically come form streaming data sources such as Kinesis Streams.\n",
    "2. Create SQL processing logic - A series of SQL statements that process input and produce output.\n",
    "3. Create an output stream - Output streams can be configured to hold intermediate results that are used to feed into other queries or be used to stream out the final results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefit of Kinesis Analytics\n",
    "The ability to maintain peak performance of a business is often related to the ability to make timely devisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data processed within real-time allows us to take preventative and/or predictive decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your SQL quering statements represent the most important part of your Kinesis Analytics application as they generate the actual analytics that you wish to derive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can involve intermediary steps, whereby the outputs of one query feed into a second in-application stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be repeated multiple times until a final desired result is achieved persisted to an output stream."
